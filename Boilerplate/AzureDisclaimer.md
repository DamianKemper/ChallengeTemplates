>[!ALERT] Azure is a dynamic, constantly evolving environment. Although we strive to keep the lab content aligned with the current Azure
environment, you you may find that the challenge instructions and guidance may not be exactly the same as what you encounter in the Azure UI. Please make allowances for this dynamic environment. In most cases, you should be able to complete the main goals of the lab.

>If you do encounter a misalignment between the Azure UI and the lab instructions, please let us know by using the feedback mechanisms at the end of the lab so that we may update the content in as timely a manner as possible.
