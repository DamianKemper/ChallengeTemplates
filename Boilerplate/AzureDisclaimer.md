>[!NOTE]Azure is a dynamic environment that is constantly evolving. And, while we strive to keep the labs aligned with the current Azure
environment, Azure is complex and has many parts. Consequently, you may find that some drift has occurred over time: 
the challenge instructions and guidance may not exactly match what you encounter in the Azure UI. By making allowances for this drift,
you should be able to complete the main goals of the challenges, perhaps not in every particular, but in the main goals presented 
in the challenge. In some rare cases, you may not be able to complete a task. Regardless of the issue you encounter, please let us
know by using the feedback mechanisms at the end of the lab.
