A cloud slice is a subset of an Azure subscription that has been assigned to a user account that was provisioned for you for the duration of this challenge lab. A cloud slice provides temporary access to a subset of resources available in a cloud subscription so that you can learn the concepts in this challenge lab without having to configure your own subscription. Note that a cloud slice restricts you to the administrative activities that are required to complete the lab. Please follow the instructions carefully, especially with regard to names and other configuration details.
