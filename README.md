# ChallengeTemplates

This repo contains templates for the different types of challenges. To use the templates, download the files and import them into a lab profile you have created. 

## IMPORTANT

Please note that, by default, when you import content into a lab profile, this action will ***overwrite*** previously existing content. If you wish to preserve the content in your lab profile, please ensure you select the option to append the imported content.
